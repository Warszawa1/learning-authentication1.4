üîê Authentication and Security

In the next projects, I explored various levels of authentication and security measures, building up to OAuth. Here are the key concepts covered in this first part:

1.**Basic Authentication (Email and Password) The simplest form of authentication. Implementation details: storing passwords securely.

2.**Encryption and Hashing
    Understanding the differences between encryption and hashing.
    Implementation of secure password hashing algorithms.

**3.Salting Passwords
    Adding salt to passwords for improved encryption.
    Preventing rainbow table attacks.

**4.Cookies and Sessions Management Using cookies to store session information securely. Best practices for session management.

**5.Environment Variables Securely managing sensitive information using environment variables. Avoiding hardcoding secrets in the source code.

**6.Google OAuth Credentials Setup Setting up Google OAuth credentials for authentication. Configuring the OAuth consent screen.

**7.Implementing "Sign In with Google" Integrating Google Sign-In into the application. Handling OAuth tokens and user sessions.
